# TMDb-async-client [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/newca12/TMDb-async-client.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/newca12/TMDb-async-client) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/newca12/TMDb-async-client/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/newca12/TMDb-async-client) [![Ohloh](http://www.ohloh.net/p/TMDb-async-client/widgets/project_thin_badge.gif)](https://www.ohloh.net/p/TMDb-async-client)

### About ###
TMDb-async-client is a native Scala SDK that provides asynchronous access to [The Movie Database][1] (TMDb) API.  
It is built heavily on [spray-client][2] for async non-blocking HTTP I/O and [spray-json][3] for parsing JSON responses into Scala case classes.  
[spray-funnel][4] is used to allow limitation of client request frequency and number of parallel requests in respect of TMDb policies.

TMDb-async-client is an EDLA project.

The purpose of [edla.org](http://www.edla.org) is to promote the state of the art in various domains.

### API Key ###
You will need an API key to The Movie Database to access the API.  To obtain a key, follow these steps:

1. Register for and verify an [account](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup).
2. [Log](https://www.themoviedb.org/login) into your account
3. Select the API section on left side of your account page.
4. Click on the link to generate a new API key and follow the instructions.

### History ###

TMDb-async-client =< 0.4 for Scala 2.10 is available on Maven Central but is no longer supported.  
TMDb-async-client >= 0.5-SNAPSHOT is for Scala 2.11 but is not yet available on Maven Central because spray-funnel [is not yet there](https://github.com/galarragas/spray-funnel/issues/4) and spray-json is not yet there either.

### Usage ###

Binary release artefacts are normally published to the [Sonatype OSS Repository Hosting service](https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html#nexus-search;quick~tmdb-async-client) and synced to Maven
Central but temporarily (waiting for Spray 2.11 release) you need to add external repositories.  
To import TMDb-async-client as a library in your own Java or Scala projects,  
add the following lines to your build.sbt file, if you are using [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup) to manage the library dependencies of your project:

```
resolvers += "spray" at "http://repo.spray.io"

resolvers += "edla repo" at "http://www.edla.org/snapshots"
```

```
   libraryDependencies += "org.edla" %% "tmdb-async-client" % "0.5-SNAPSHOT"
```

or add the following lines to your pom.xml file, if you are using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) instead:

```
    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>spray</id>
            <name>spray</name>
            <url>http://repo.spray.io/</url>
            <layout>default</layout>
        </repository>
        <repository>
            <id>edlarepo</id>
            <name>edla repo</name>
            <url>http://www.edla.org/snapshots/</url>
            <layout>default</layout>
        </repository>
    </repositories>
```

```
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.edla</groupId>
       <artifactId>tmdb-async-client_2.11</artifactId>
       <version>0.5-SNAPSHOT</version>
   </dependency>
```

See [Usage.scala](https://github.com/newca12/TMDb-async-client/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/edla/tmdb/client/Usage.scala) for a runnable example.

Each function returns a `Future` of the response from the TMDb API, parsed into a convenient case class.

``` scala
  val apiKey = "REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_OWN_API_KEY"

  val tmdbClient = TmdbClient(apiKey)

  val movie = tmdbClient.getMovie(54181)

  val movies = tmdbClient.searchMovie("shark")

  tmdbClient.downloadPoster(movie, "/tmp/poster.jpg")

  tmdbClient.shutdown
```
