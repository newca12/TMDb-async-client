### About ###
TMDb-async-client is a native Scala SDK that provides asynchronous access to [The Movie Database][1] (TMDb) API.  
It is built heavily on [spray-client][2] for async non-blocking HTTP I/O and [spray-json][3] for parsing JSON responses into Scala case classes.

TMDb-async-client is an EDLA project.

The purpose of [edla.org](http://www.edla.org) is to promote the state of the art in various domains.

### API Key ###
You will need an API key to The Movie Database to access the API.  To obtain a key, follow these steps:

1. Register for and verify an [account](https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup).
2. [Log](https://www.themoviedb.org/login) into your account
3. Select the API section on left side of your account page.
4. Click on the link to generate a new API key and follow the instructions.

### Usage

Binary release artefacts are published to the [Sonatype OSS Repository Hosting service](https://oss.sonatype.org/index.html#nexus-search;quick~tmdb-async-client) and synced to Maven
Central.  
To import TMDb-async-client as a library in your own Java or Scala projects,  
add the following line to your build.sbt file, if you are using [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup) to manage the library dependencies of your project:

```
   libraryDependencies += "org.edla" %% "tmdb-async-client" % "0.3"
```

or add the following lines to your pom.xml file, if you are using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) instead:

```
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.edla</groupId>
       <artifactId>tmdb-async-client_2.10</artifactId>
       <version>0.3</version>
   </dependency>
```

See [Usage.scala](https://github.com/newca12/TMDb-async-client/blob/master/src/main/scala/org/edla/tmdb/Usage.scala) for a runnable example.

Each function returns a `Future` of the response from the TMDb API, parsed into a convenient case class.

``` scala
  val apiKey = "REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_OWN_API_KEY"

  val tmdbClient = TmdbClient(apiKey)

  val movie = tmdbClient.getMovie(54181)

  val movies = tmdbClient.searchMovie("shark")

  tmdbClient.downloadPoster(movie, "/tmp/poster.jpg")

  tmdbClient.shutdown
```
